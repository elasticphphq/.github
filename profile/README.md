## Hi there 👋

Welcome to **ElasticPHP** — the home of open source tools for monitoring, scaling, and optimizing PHP workloads.

We’re building robust and modular solutions written in Go and PHP to support:
- 🧠 **Autodiscovery** of PHP-FPM pools
- 📈 **Metrics exporting** for Prometheus
- 🚀 **Autoscaling** of Laravel queue workers and FPM processes
- 🧰 **Developer tooling** for introspection, performance tuning, and observability

### 🌍 Projects

- [`elasticphp-agent`](https://github.com/elasticphphq/elasticphp-agent) – A FastCGI-based agent for collecting metrics and controlling PHP-FPM behavior
- [`fcgx`](https://github.com/elasticphphq/fcgx) – Lightweight FastCGI client for Go, tailored for PHP-FPM integrations

### 💡 Contributing

Whether it's bug reports, feature ideas, or pull requests — you're very welcome. Start by checking out our individual repositories for contribution guidelines.

### 📚 Documentation

You’ll find documentation in each project’s `README.md`

### 🛠 Philosophy

We believe PHP deserves first-class observability and tooling, just like any other runtime. Our mission is to close the gap between developer ergonomics and production-grade operations for PHP applications — especially in containerized and serverless environments.
